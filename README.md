# Rock-Paper-Scissor
Developed a Rock-Paper-Scissor game using Java. The game is a two-player game in which each person simultaneously chooses either rock, paper, or scissors. Rock beats scissors but loses to paper, paper beats rock but loses to scissors, and scissors beats paper but loses to rock. The game uses the Scanner class to get the player's move and the Random class to generate the computer's move.The game keeps track of the score of each player and displays the winner at the end of the game.
